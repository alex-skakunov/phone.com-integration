1. Local env
  + commit the updates to repositiry
  + copy the database
  + setup the local scripts
  + write some Unit tests to automate the check that everything works as expected

2. New approach to save
  + make the numbers mapping in the databases
  + create queue table
  + rewrite the code to save the numbers to queue (without calling the API)
  + when adding a record, check if it already exists with status=success
  + investigate the API docs if the call can have multiple records
  + write a worker script: get a few records and call the API one by one
  * merge 2 tables together: logs + update_logs

3. New approach for the backup script
  * run on hourly basis
  + check the successful records in DB first

4. New approach for the "more than X" script
  * find out the interval and change it

5. Fix the failed numbers
  * just write a script to fix those
